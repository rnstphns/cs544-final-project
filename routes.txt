student access:
route -- where implemented so far
GET /registration-events/latest - studentcontroller, clientcontroller, clientgateway
POST /registration-events/request -- eventcontroller,<notclientside>
GET /registrations/{studentId}  -- <not implemented>

sysadmin access:
GET POST PUT DELETE /registration-events/{id}
GET POST PUT DELETE /student/{id}/registrations/{id}
GET POST PUT DELETE /student/{id}/registration-requests/{id}
GET POST PUT DELETE /registration-groups/{id}
PATCH /registration-events/{id}?processed=true -- calls code to assign registrations based on registration requests

##maybe we don't implement all 4 repository's worth of methods?


Use-cases (from project description)
1. Students should be able to GET /registration-events/latest and receive the most recent
RegistrationEvent. By looking at the start and end datetime, you should be able to tell if registration
is open, closed or in progress.
2. RegistrationEvent is a complex object that consists of multiple RegistrationGroups and each group
consists of a list of students and a list of blocks. Each block has a list of course offerings.
3. SysAmin should be able to perform CRUD operations on RegistrationEvent. You can break
RegistrationEvent down to pieces and let the user create/update these parts piece by piece.
4. When students read RegistrationEvent, system filters the list of registration groups to the one that
student is a member of. Furthermore, the list of students will be masked for student view. So,
students see RegistrationEvent -> RegistrationGroups -> AcademicBlocks -> CourseOfferings
(in the list of course offerings, highlight the course that the student is actually registered for)

5. Students can submit a list of RegistrationRequest objects. There should be one object per course
offering for all blocks available to select from (you should validate that). The system will allow the
student to save the list during an active RegistrationEvent (between the start and end date & time).
-validate date in method - if(date.now is after current registration event date && before end date) - pull object from DB and save in service method?
-getAvailableBlocks
-validateStudentRequest

6. Students should be able to see a list of Registrations. GET /registrations

7. SysAdmin should be able to “process” a registration event by calling:
PATCH /registration-events/{id}?processed=true
